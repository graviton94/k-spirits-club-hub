# Cloudflare Pages Configuration
# This file tells Cloudflare Pages to ignore the deploy command and use automatic deployment

# Build settings are configured in the Cloudflare dashboard:
# - Framework preset: Next.js
# - Build command: npm run build
# - Build output directory: (auto-detected by Next.js)

# The "Deploy command" in dashboard settings should be set to: exit 0
# This README exists to document the deployment configuration
